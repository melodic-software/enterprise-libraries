            <summary>
            Indicates that an assembly should be automatically loaded.
            This is primarily used to help target specific assemblies when executing dynamic behavior.
            Some examples of this are dynamic options, service, and middleware registrations.
            Using the attribute provides an assembly metadata target for scanning and inspection,
            which is less expensive than loading all assemblies.
