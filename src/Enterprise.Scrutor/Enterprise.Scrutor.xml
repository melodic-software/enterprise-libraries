            <summary>
            This auto wires anything that has the [ServiceDescriptor] attribute.
            There is a bit of a code smell to this because the classes have awareness of how they should be injected.
            It also requires projects to have a reference to the Scrutor library because the attribute is defined there.

            <summary>
            These still have a bit of a code smell, but do NOT require a dependency on Scrutor.
